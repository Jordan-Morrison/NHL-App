# NHL App

This app was created for a job interview in which the following requirements were put in place:

1. Using the nhl api specs here https://github.com/erunion/sport-api-specifications/tree/master/nhl, design an app, with a menu/drawer on the left listing all the team names with logos.
2. When you click/tap a team, the page lists a feed of players listing #, name, and position. Add sorting capability on both the name and #
3. Add filter capability on the position
4. Upon clicking a player, load a page or modal displaying the country name and flag of the nationality of the player
